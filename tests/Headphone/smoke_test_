smoke test is the minimal requirnment of feature test so product can be run at least basic level.
compulsory require test

test which are must for product requienment mark as smoke test
ex in car test_engine is smoke test
           test_body is also an smoke test



      same as like as mark we are used to group that test and eun that test


      @mark.smoke above of test so we can run group of test so we can deploy projet basic featre at least

      @mark.smoke
      def test_head_sound():
        return Yes



      test 2

      @mark.smoke
      def test_button_of_headphone():
        return working_fine



        Run Smoke test command  : pytest -m smoke   it will run all test case which are marked as smoke


        if we want to run the test case which is not marke as smoke then just
        Run command
        pytest -m "not smoke"

        all test case which arw not marked as smoke run if mark diffrent name then also that test case also run


        we can run two test and rum that  mark using or and and

        ex

        pytest -m "smoke or earbud"



        pytest -m "smoke and earbud"



        we can mark class also and run the whole class test case
        same as we run function or testcase
