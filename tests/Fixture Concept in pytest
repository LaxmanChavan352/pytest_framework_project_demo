in pytest fixture concept use to save code and time time through fixture we can achive code reusability

we are create a conftest.py file in root directory of project folder so we can be acces that conftest everywere
in project.

conftest code present for whole project

it will run before actual test run

best use browser invocation code in selenium

conftest demo

conftest.py

from selenium import webdriver
from pytest import fixture
@fixture(scope='class/session/function')
def get_browser():
    driver=webdriver.ChromeOption(executable_pat("c\\chromedriver"))
    return driver

 # one demo method how invoke that conftest fixture into this testcase
def test_dummy_tescase(get_browser):
    browser=get_browser()
    browser.get(https:\\google.com)


this is the way we can use fixture in pytest
